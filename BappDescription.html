<p> This extension complements Burp's active scanner by substituting integer and booleean JSON values with their string equivalents to check if variable types are being checked on the server's side. </p>
<p>Any JSON body in HTTP request will be re-submitted with the string equivalent.</p>
<p>If the HTTP response is successful, it would indicate that variable types are not being check on the server side.</p>
